# Phase-1-Project
Welcome to my phase 1 project. This is a simple pokemon battler app.

1. Pick a pokemon for yourself using the random button / the form to submit for a pokemon of your choice

2. Generate a random pokemon for the cpu

3. Click the battle button to find the winner!

The battle has two methods to find a victor, battle by type and battle by weight.
By-type checks the pokemon's types against each other, if one is super effective against the other, than we have a winner by type (pikachu being an electic type will always win against any water or flying types). By-weight will only get triggered if no winner is found by type. By-weight will check the weight in kilograms of each pokemon, whichever one is heavier will win.

Have fun!

Hint: you can randomize as many times as you would like before each battle(for both yourself and the cpu).
