# Phase-1-Project
Welcome to my phase 1 project. This is a simple Pokémon battler app.


1. Pick a Pokémon for yourself. You can either choose your own Pokémon by typing their name into the text box or have a random Pokémon assigned to you.

2. Generate a random Pokémon for the CPU by clicking the "CPU Random" button.

3. Click the battle button to find the winner!

The first to win 3 rounds wins the match.

Note: There must be a Pokémon chosen for both the player and the cpu to initiate a battle.

The battle has two methods to find a victor: battle by type and battle by weight.
Battling by type checks the Pokémon's types against each other; if one is super effective against the other, then we have a winner by type. For example, Pikachu being an electric type will always win against any water or flying types. By weight battling will only get triggered if no winner is found by type. By weight will check the weight in kilograms of each Pokémon and whichever is heavier will win.

Have fun!

Hint: you can randomize as many times as you would like before each battle (for both yourself and the CPU).
